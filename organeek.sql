Because of misperceptions, many fashion magazines, dermatologists, and even cosmetics salespeople advise against using a toner, or simply dismiss toners as an optional step. That is disappointing, because a well-formulated toner can provide truly amazing benefits for your skin.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you understand how toners work, and know what ingredients are included in some toners that can be bad for your skin and what ingredients are essential for achieving a healthy, radiant glow, you&#39;ll find that applying a toner can be the perfect addition to your skin-care routine!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>All About Toners</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Toners are meant to be used after cleansing. They once were recommended as a way to restore skin&#39;s pH balance after using a bar soap or bar cleanser because those types of cleansers raise the skin&#39;s natural pH to a level that isn&#39;t good for your skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, with today&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/cleansers/">gentle, water-soluble cleansers</a>, the skin&#39;s pH doesn&#39;t change appreciably, and the fact that skin&#39;s pH recovers just fine on its own made the need for toners to adjust skin&#39;s pH fade away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we now know is that after cleansing, what your skin needs is a range of ingredients that restore and repair its surface. Skin can never get too much of these important ingredients, which include antioxidants and skin-repairing substances such as glycerin, fatty acids, and ceramides.&nbsp;<strong>The right toner can give your skin a healthy dose of what it needs to look younger, fresher, and smoother, right after cleansing and throughout the day.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is the Difference Between Toners?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding the perfect toner for your skin isn&#39;t easy, mainly because there are so many poorly formulated toners. Basically, toners can be divided into three general types:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Alcohol-based formulas</strong>&nbsp;that often include &quot;astringent&quot; ingredients such as witch hazel. Toners with alcohol and astringent ingredients should always be avoided because they cause free-radical damage and irritation, which hurts your skin&#39;s ability to repair itself and damages its ability to produce healthy collagen.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Water and glycerin or glycol-based formulas with fragrant extracts</strong>&nbsp;such as rose water or citrus fruits. These types of toners often are labeled fresheners or clarifiers, and are little more than eau de cologne for your face. Such overly fragrant toners are a common cause of reactions that are damaging to skin.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Water-based formulas</strong>&nbsp;loaded with beneficial ingredients such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/skin-identical-ingredients/skin-identical-ingredients">skin-repairing substances</a>,<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/antioxidants/antioxidant">antioxidants</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/cell-communicating-ingredients">cell-communicating ingredients</a>&nbsp;such as niacinamide.&nbsp;<strong>These are the ONLY types of toner we recommend.</strong>&nbsp;We guarantee that every&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/toners/">toner from Paula&#39;s Choice</a>&nbsp;matches this description, and there are similar toners from other brands we recommend on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia/">Beautypedia</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Can I Skip the Toner?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If the toner is well formulated, Paula and her team strongly recommend that you make toner an essential part of your cleansing routine because the benefits can be felt and seen almost instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, absolutely do not use any toner that contains irritating ingredients, such as alcohol, citrus, or overly fragrant ingredients, whether they are synthetic or natural. Irritation hurts your skin&#39;s healing process and reduces healthy collagen production&mdash;two things you must avoid if you want to improve your skin!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the toner you&#39;re considering is filled with great ingredients (like the toners from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/toners/">Paula&#39;s Choice</a>), then skipping this step is cheating your skin of more of the beneficial ingredients it needs to become healthier and act younger! A toner that contains state-of-the-art ingredients proven to smooth, soften, calm, and repair skin is a wonderful addition to anyone&#39;s skin-care routine!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Toners for Different Skin Types</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Toners for Oily or Blemish-Prone Skin:</strong>&nbsp;If you have oily or blemish-prone skin, you need to be especially careful when shopping for toners. Almost without exception, the toners that claim to be specifically for these skin types and concerns are not going to help. Why are they a problem? They&#39;re a problem because most toners for oily, blemish-prone skin contain irritants (such as alcohol, witch hazel, or menthol) that hurt your skin&#39;s healing process, make blemishes worse, and, surprisingly, stimulate oil production at the base of the pore. Using the wrong toner on oily, blemish-prone skin guarantees you&#39;ll see more oil, overall redness and longer-lasting red marks, and possibly a dry, flaky surface with oily skin underneath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toners that are best for oily or blemish-prone skin are those whose ingredients help repair skin&#39;s surface, make skin feel smoother, reduce enlarged pores, and contain cell-communicating ingredients that help train pores to handle excess oil in a more efficient manner. For some skin types, especially during summer or in warmer climates, a well-formulated toner may be the only &quot;moisturizer&quot; your oily skin needs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Toners for Dry or Sensitive Skin:</strong>&nbsp;Those with dry or sensitive skin typically shy away from toners because of their astringent, drying reputation. After all, the last thing dry, sensitive skin needs are irritants that make it even drier or redder! But the right toner for dry or sensitive skin can make a world of difference: You&#39;ll see less redness, less flaking, and your skin will feel soothed and comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re skeptical (and we can&#39;t say we blame you) give a well-formulated toner a try&mdash;we&#39;re betting you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised with how your skin improves!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Toners for Combination Skin:</strong>&nbsp;If your skin is oily on your forehead, nose, and chin and dry to normal on your cheeks and jaw area, then you have classic combination skin. Using the wrong toner on combination skin will exaggerate the dry areas and make oily areas worse (this is doubly true if blemishes are present).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s the solution? You need a gentle, alcohol-free toner with ingredients that help normalize your skin, so you&#39;ll see less dryness and reduced oiliness. With ongoing use as part of a complete skin-care routine, you&#39;ll also see enlarged pores become smaller.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Which Paula&#39;s Choice Toner is Right for Me?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although every Paula&#39;s Choice toner contains a range of ingredients that provide multiple benefits, each has distinctions that make them preferred for certain skin types or concerns:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Toners for Aging and Sun Damage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All Paula&#39;s Choice toners are excellent options for anti-aging and for helping to repair sun damage while also addressing other concerns. In addition, you can alternate, using any of our toners along with RESIST Advanced Replenishing Toner for wonderful results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you might have gathered from the above discussion, when shopping for toners it&#39;s critical that you make sure you consider only those that treat your skin to nothing but beneficial ingredients.&nbsp;<strong>There is never&mdash;never&mdash;a good reason to use a toner with irritants</strong>, regardless of the claims on the label. A brilliantly formulated toner, on the other hand, can be a valuable addition to your skin-care routine, whether your concern is anti-aging or you&#39;re struggling with dryness, excess oil, sensitivity, or the dual nature of combination skin.</p>\r\n', 'blogs/images/Toner1.jpg', 'blogs/thumbnail/Toner1.jpg', 0, 'Beauty', 'face care', 0, 0, '2014-07-02 21:52:09'),
(7, 0, 'Is toner an essential part of beauty regimen?	', '<p>First, we need to understand the benefits of using toner, its composition and how it works in order to evaluate its necessity to our daily&rsquo;s skin care regimen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikipedia refers toner to a lotion or wash designed to cleanse the skin and shrink the appearance of pores, usually used on the face. Toner is usually used after facial cleansing and works to restore skin&rsquo;s pH balance after using harsh chemicals like bar or liquid soap or facial wash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most fundamental thing that we need to understand in skin care is the pH balance. To understand the pH (potential Hydrogen) balance of our skin is tantamount to a knowledge in all areas of skin regimen. The golden rule is that anything you apply to your skin will alter your skin surface pH and that includes &nbsp;water! &nbsp;Most available facial cleansers which are conveniently sold in local supermarket and pharmacy are either too alkaline or too acidic due to its harsh chemicals and subsequently mess up the pH balance of the skin. (Read: pH balance article to understand skin pH balance further).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Types of Toner</strong><br />\r\nFinding the right toners are no-brainers and easy to decide knowing exactly what ingredients or chemicals are put in the toner. Skin toners are classified into three categories:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astringents - These are the strongest form of toner and contain a high proportion of alcohol (20&ndash;60%), antiseptic ingredients, water, and a humectant ingredient. These are commonly recommended for oily skins as they are drying. Removal of oil from the skin does not cause overproduction of oil as there are no structures in the skin that provides a mechanism that will send a negative feedback to the oil glands that the skin has become dry and it needs to compensate for that condition. To compensate for that dryness, it would be recommended to use a water based, non comedogenic facial moisturizer.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Skin Bracers or Fresheners - These are the mildest form of toners; they contain water and a humectant such as glycerine, and little if any alcohol (0&ndash;10%). Humectants help to keep the moisture in the upper layers of the epidermis by preventing it from evaporating. A popular example of this is rosewater. These toners are the gentlest to the skin, and are most suitable for use on dry, dehydrated, sensitive and normal skins. It may give a burning sensation to sensitive skin.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Skin Tonics - These are slightly stronger and contain a small quantity of alcohol (up to 20%), water and a humectant ingredient. Orange flower water is an example of a skin tonic. Skin tonics are suitable for use on normal, combination, and oily skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the Right Type of Toner<br />\r\nFrom the above description, choosing the right toner for any skin type could not be any easier or obvious. choose toner that is irritant and alcohol-free and has great benefits of antioxidant, vitamins and sun-damage repair formula. Under no circumstances you should use toner that has astringent, citrus, fragrance (natural or synthetic) and other chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I Skip Using Toner?</strong><br />\r\nThe answer to this really depends on the type of facial wash that is used prior to toning, needs of skin and largely depends on the type of toner that will be used. Using an excellent toner that is free from harsh chemicals will definitely improve skin condition and is an excellent addition to daily skin regimen. On the other hand, skipping toner is altogether way better than using a poor-quality toner that would only subject your skin to stress, chemicals, irritation and degradation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'blogs/images/toner.jpg', 'blogs/thumbnail/toner.jpg', 0, 'Beauty', 'Face', 0, 1, '2014-06-27 08:05:01'),

But more than a marketing gimmick, what does pH mean and what how does it affect our skin?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is pH&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nChemistry 101 teachers us that pH (potential Hydrogen) measures the acidity or alkalinity &nbsp;of &nbsp;water &nbsp;solution.

To maintain healthy and functioning skin, skin surface pH values should be somewhere between 4.5 and 6. However, several studies had shown that that skin with pH values below 5 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5. It &nbsp;is estimated that the &#39;natural&#39; skin surface pH is on average 4.7, i.e. below 5. This is in line with existing literature, where a relatively large number of reports (c. 50%) actually describes pH values below 5.0; this is in contrast to the general assumption, that skin surface pH is on average between 5.0 and 6.0</p>\r\n', 'blogs/images/pH.jpg', 'blogs/thumbnail/pH.jpg', 0, 'Beauty', 'Body and Skin Care', 0, 1, '2014-06-27 08:05:02'),
